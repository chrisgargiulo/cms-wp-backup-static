<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A User Centered Design Approach</h3>



<p>The web design and development process shares several resemblances to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">software development process</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle">systems development life cycle</a> and is influenced by the rich history and practice of related fields such as systems engineering and information science. Building upon several influential methodologies and preceding models, the following is a simple 5-Step process specifically for web design and development that embraces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">User-centered design (UCD)</a>and consists of 5 D’s: <em>Define, Draft, Design, Develop, and Deliver.</em></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>User-centered design (UCD)</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>user-driven development (UDD)</strong>&nbsp;is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks and workflow of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and envision the way users are likely to consume a product, but also to validate their assumptions with regard to the user behavior in real world tests. These tests are conducted with/without actual users during each stage of the process from requirements, pre-production models and post production, completing a circle of proof back to and ensuring that “development proceeds with the user as the center of focus.
</p><cite>–&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Simplified 5-Step Process:</h3>



<ol><li><strong>Define</strong>&nbsp;– Define the project, problem(s), and stakeholder’s primary goals via the project brief. Gather background info to define user profiles, goals, and tasks.</li><li><strong>Draft</strong>&nbsp;– Brainstorm conceptual solutions; draft the information architecture, site-maps, wireframes, prototypes, content hierarchy, and structure.</li><li><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;– Visualize and communicate the user interface design via mood boards, type studies, color studies, prototypes, iterative mockups, and multiple rounds of refinements.</li><li><strong>Develop</strong>&nbsp;– Build the interactive, fully functioning product using web standard compliant, accessible, valid, semantic markup, styling, and scripting.</li><li><strong>Deliver</strong>&nbsp;– Via due diligence, fix all bugs and conduct multiple tests for quality assurance across multiple platforms, browsers, devices, and screen-sizes.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Brief Backstory</h2>



<p><em>Preceding Influential Models</em></p>



<p>One of the most notable approaches that predates web development is the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>: a linear, step-by-step sequential process that is inherently flawed due to the fact that, like a waterfall, it only flows in one direction. Broken down into five phases, a typical waterfall process entails defining system requirements, designing, implementing/coding, testing, and maintaining.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="264" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.creativemedia.space/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/process-waterfall.gif?resize=1200%2C264&#038;ssl=1" alt="A waterfall process" class="wp-image-1379" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div>



<p><em>A waterfall process</em></p>



<p>In the text Usability for the Web (2002), Brinck, Gergle, and Wood illustrated a “Pervasive Usability Process” drafted specifically for web design and development. It consists of five phases that are sequential yet iterative through the process of continual evaluation. The five stages are requirements analysis, conceptual design, mockups and prototypes, production, and launch, and most closely resembles the Five D’s approach above.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="419" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.creativemedia.space/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/process-pervasive.gif?resize=1200%2C419&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brinck, Gergle, and Wood’s 2001 Pervasive Usability Process" class="wp-image-1378" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div>



<p><em>Brinck, Gergle, and Wood’s 2001 Pervasive Usability Process</em></p>



<p>In contrast to the waterfall model, other notable approaches are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design">iterative design</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">incremental development</a>, cyclical design and development processes that entail multiple rounds of designing, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="551" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.creativemedia.space/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/process-iterative.gif?resize=1200%2C551&#038;ssl=1" alt="An iterative process" class="wp-image-1377" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div>



<p><em>An iterative process</em></p>



<p>In recent years, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development process</a>&nbsp;has had a big impact on web design and development. It embraces adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement. Designed for speed, it encourages rapid and flexible responses to change throughout the process.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="551" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.creativemedia.space/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/process-iterative-modified.gif?resize=1200%2C551&#038;ssl=1" alt="A combined iterative and incremental “5 D” process influenced by multiple models." class="wp-image-1376" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all web design and development process. However, there are several existing models to follow as frameworks that embrace different principles related to user-centered design.</p>

<h3>Articles by Jakob Nielsen at NN/G:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-mistakes-web-design/"><strong>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s Top 10 Mistakes in Web Design</strong></a><br />
A short list of egregious offenses against users, such as Bad Search, PDF files for online reading, not changing the color of visited links, non-scannable text (the &#8220;wall of text&#8221;), fixed font sizes, poor page titles, anything that looks like an ad, violating design conventions, opening new browser windows, and not answering user questions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-good-deeds-in-web-design/"><strong>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s 10 Good Deeds in Web Design</strong></a><br />
Ten design elements that would increase the usability of all websites if they were employed more widely. List includes things such as placing your name and logo on every page and make the logo a link to the home page, providing search if the site has more than 100 pages, and writing straightforward and simple headlines and page titles.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-10-ia-mistakes/"><strong>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s Top 10 Information Architecture (IA) Mistakes</strong></a><br />
Structure and navigation must support each other and integrate with search and across subsites. Complexity, inconsistency, hidden options, and clumsy UI mechanics prevent users from finding what they need.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"><strong>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s Usability 101: Introduction to Usability</strong></a><br />
Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word &#8220;usability&#8221; also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process. Usability is defined by 5 quality components: Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors, and Satisfaction.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-ten-guidelines-for-homepage-usability/"><strong>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s Top 10 Guidelines for Homepage Usability</strong></a><br />
The homepage is often times the starting point for user visits. Improving the homepage multiplies the entire website&#8217;s value, so following key guidelines for homepage usability is important.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/"><strong>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s 10 Most Violated Homepage Design Guidelines</strong></a><br />
A short list of ten usability mistakes that about two-thirds of corporate websites make, according to Nielsen Norman Group. The prevalence of these errors alone warrants attention.</li>
