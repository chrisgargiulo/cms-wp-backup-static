User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem-solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and envision the way users are likely to consume a product, but also to validate their assumptions with regard to the user behavior in real world tests. These tests are conducted with\/without actual users during each stage of the process from requirements, pre-production models and post production, completing a circle of proof back to and ensuring that \u201cdevelopment proceeds with the user as the center of focus.\n<\/p><cite>\u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User-centered_design\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"455\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.creativemedia.space\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/process-ddddd.gif?resize=1500%2C455&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Design Process: 5 D's: Define, Draft, Design, Develop, and Deliver\" class=\"wp-image-1375\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Simplified 5-Step Process:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Define<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Define the project, problem(s), and stakeholder\u2019s primary goals via the project brief.
