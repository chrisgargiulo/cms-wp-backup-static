As a learning resource with teaching materials used for in-class purposes, some pages offer the ability for users to leave comments on the site and the content management system will typically collect some user data, such as the content shown in the comments form, as well as the visitor\u2019s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may also be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https:\/\/automattic.com\/privacy\/. Once\/if your comment is posted, your profile picture will be visible to the public in the context of your comment. If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year. If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select &#8220;Remember Me&#8221;, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed. If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day. In regards to media, if you upload any images, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website. In regards to embedded media from other websites, articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These third-party websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. In regards to data storage, if you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely (by system default). This is so site owners can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. For users that register on our website, the system stores the personal information provided in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information. If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We respect your privacy and therefore will do our best to accommodate your privacy needs.
